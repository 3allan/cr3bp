The *Kepler* (2-body) problem is fundamental to the study of astrodynamics, especially so for analyzing the more general 3-body problem. It consists of determining the positions of 2 bodies under mutual Newtonian gravitational attraction with respect to an inertial frame.

Here, we assume (without loss of generality) that :math:`m_1 \geqslant m_2` are the body masses.

The equations of motion for the general 2-body problem are derived below using a variety of methods.
