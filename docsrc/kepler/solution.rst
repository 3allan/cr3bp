    The solution of the *general* 2-body problem is developed several
    different ways utilizing the now known special
    :ref:`properties<Properties>` admitted by the system.

Coordinate Rotation
-------------------
Knowing that the motion **must** be 2-dimensional, we can choose a more
convenient coordinate system via a coordinate rotation. Let this rotation
be denoted :math:`\mathbf{R} \in \mathrm{SO}(3)` such that

.. math::
    \begin{pmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{R} \begin{pmatrix}X \\ Y \\ Z\end{pmatrix}.

Note that the vectors on the LHS and RHS both represent the **same** object
:math:`\mathbf{r}`, just that the expressions are different because of the
object being described by two different coordinate systems.
